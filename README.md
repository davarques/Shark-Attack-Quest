## Mission
The mission of this quest is to clean the messy ["Shark Attacks"](https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) dataset using data wrangling techniques, preparing it for insightful analysis.

## Objectives
- Advance Python skills
- Transition towards becoming a proficient data analyst
- Enhance teamwork and collaboration
- Develop problem-solving capabilities

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Clean and structure the 'Shark Attacks' dataset to uncover valuable insights.
- **Outcome:** Gather actionable information to mitigate 'Shark Attack' incidents.

## Hypotheses Tested
### Hypothesis 1
- Shark attacks are more likely to occur in specific locations and during certain seasons.
- **Learning:** Location (Country & State) and season significantly impact shark attack risks.
- **Key Finding:** Summer emerges as the primary season for shark attacks globally.
- **Future Considerations:** Investigate how summer conditions influence attack rates (e.g., water temperature, human presence).

### Hypothesis 2
- Certain activities and human factors, like gender, influence shark attack occurrences.
- **Insights:** Activities play a role in attack risks, but gender has minimal correlations.
- **Implications:** Use insights to enhance shark attack prevention strategies, such as warning campaigns, beach patrols, and medical support in high-risk areas (USA, Australia, South Africa).

## Conclusion
Through rigorous data cleaning and analysis, we've gained crucial insights into shark attack patterns, paving the way for effective prevention and response measures.
